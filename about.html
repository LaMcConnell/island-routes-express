                <h2>Our Founding Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Island Routes Express was founded with a simple but powerful mission:
                    to connect communities across the island through safe, reliable,
                    and comfortable transportation. Recognizing the need for a bus service
                    that prioritizes punctuality, passenger comfort, and accessibility,
                    our founders came together to create a company that blends modern
                    technology, well-maintained vehicles, and a customer-first approach.
                    From humble beginnings with just a few routes, Island Routes Express
                    has grown into a trusted transportation provider, committed to making
                    every journey seamless and enjoyable for every passenger.
